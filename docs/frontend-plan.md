# Svaraa V0 — Frontend Plan & Timeline

Nov 2, 2026 · Pragati. Source: `docs/source/frontend-plan-timeline.docx`.

## Overview

Two frontend developers build the Svaraa app for iOS, Android and web. Internal release: Jan 8, 2027.

- All 28 screens from the wireframes, in English and Hindi.
- Web: caretaker screens and the setup-link page only.
- Pendant: simulator now, real Bluetooth later, with no screen changes.
- Not now: music, news, reminders (the app is ready to add them).

## App structure

```
svaraa-mobile/
├── app/        screens only (auth, onboarding, j/[token], main)
├── features/   auth, circles, devices, invites, consent, sos
├── services/   api, pendant, voice, push   ← all outside calls
├── ui/         design system + caretaker/wearer themes
├── i18n/       en.json, hi.json
└── config/     env, feature flags, simulator/BLE switch
```

## Rules

- Screens never call the backend, Bluetooth or WebSocket directly; only services/ does.
- Pendant uses one interface: SimulatorTransport now, BleTransport later, switched in config.
- Setup progress comes from the server, so users can resume anytime.
- No hard-coded text; every word lives in en.json and hi.json.
- Wearer screens use the large-size theme: bigger text and buttons, same screens.
- New features (music, news) = a new folder + a feature flag.

## Working with backend

Backend agrees on each API first. Frontend lists what each screen needs; backend adds the endpoint to /docs with sample data; frontend generates code from /openapi.json and builds on mock data; backend makes it live; frontend switches from mock to real.

| Backend gives us                                   | Who      | By                            |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| Railway URL + /docs                                | Person 4 | Week 1                        |
| interface_spec.md + simulator                      | Person 2 | Week 1–2                      |
| Login APIs                                         | Person 1 | Week 1 (draft), week 3 (live) |
| Circles, claim, consent, contacts, setup-link APIs | Person 1 | Week 2 (draft), week 4 (live) |
| Voice WebSocket format                             | Person 3 | Week 2                        |
| Push + feature-flag APIs                           | Person 4 | Week 4–5                      |

## Merging code

One repo; main is protected and always builds. Branch per ticket (`feat/FE-04-caretaker-setup`), merged within 1–2 days. Every PR reviewed by the other person, under 400 lines. CI must pass: lint, type check, tests, missing Hindi text check. Rebase on main every morning; shared folders (ui/, config/) change in small separate PRs.

## AI tool usage

Shared CLAUDE.md. Use AI for screens, tests, mock data, first-draft Hindi and PR notes. Write by hand (AI assists only): pendant/Bluetooth, background audio, login, consent and SOS.

## Milestones

|     | Date   | Done when                                                 |
| --- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| M1  | Nov 13 | API drafts + pendant spec shared; design system merged    |
| M2  | Dec 11 | Both setup paths work end to end on the simulator         |
| M3  | Dec 18 | All 28 screens done in EN + HI; push and background work  |
| M4  | Jan 8  | Tested on devices; TestFlight + Play internal builds live |

Saturday demos every week on real phones; Friday 4 pm merge stops and an EAS build goes to demo phones. Screens on mock data are labelled "demo data".

## Risks

- Backend APIs late → keep building on mock data.
- iOS stops audio when phone locks → test in week 1; fallback: voice works with app open only.
- Pendant spec keeps changing → freeze version 1 by Nov 13.
